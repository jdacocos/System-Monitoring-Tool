# System Monitoring Tool — Process Integration Branch

## Branch Overview: `process-integration`

The **`process-integration`** branch focuses on the **process management and integration layer** of the system monitoring tool. This branch is responsible for:

- Retrieving and structuring process data from the system.
- Managing concurrency and live updates through multithreading.
- Integrating backend data modules with the UI.
- Handling signal-based process control for responsive and safe monitoring.

This branch serves as the **core of process-related functionality**, allowing the tool to display real-time system information and manage processes efficiently.
